# Fetch-tenant-name-from-tenant-ID
Script to grab a tenant name from their ID for MS partners.

I created this as a response to notifications from Azure backup. A critical notification only gives the tenant ID and when managing multiple tenants I needed a way to identify the company that we were being notified about. I wrote this simple script to be able to query the name.

Please note that you will need to have the required modules installed for PowerShell, please see my other repository here () for a quick script to achieve this.
